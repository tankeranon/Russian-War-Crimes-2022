# Methodology for War Crime Classifications
Derivation of the four classifications from the 34 war crime definitions of Rome Statute Article 8, sections 
(a) and (b) defining war crimes within the context of an international conflict, where (a) is defined as
"Grave Breaches of the Geneva Convention" and (b) is defined as "Serious Violations of International Law 
Applicable to International Armed Conflict".

Court-Related

The Russian invasion of Ukraine falls under the definition of an international conflict, so sections of 
Article 8 (2)(c), (2)(d), (2)(e), and (2)(f) do not apply. Furthermore, classifications under `Court-Related` are 
not (as of now) relevant and thus are omitted. This is an ongoing conflict and we will adjust classifications
as necessary.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine falls under the definition of an international conflict, so sections of Article 8 (2)(c), (2)(d), (2)(e), and (2)(f) do not apply. Furthermore, numerous classifications are not (as of now) common Russian war crime occurrences, and are omitted. The omitted list is located below.

### Omitted Classifications
The following classifications are not (as of now) documented types of Russian war crimes and thus are omitted from the types of classification. This is an ongoing conflict and we will include them if the situation on the ground changes.

All war crime definitions are derived from the ICC (International Criminal Court) which are in turn derived from the Geneva Conventions. 

[Rome Statue of the International Criminal Court](https://www.icc-cpi.int/resource-library/Documents/RS-Eng.pdf) (See Article 8 War Crimes) <br />
[Elements of Crimes](https://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/336923D8-A6AD-40EC-AD7B-45BF9DE73D56/0/ElementsOfCrimesEng.pdf) (See Article 8 War Crimes)

The Russian invasion of Ukraine falls under the definition of an international conflict, so sections of Article 8 (2)(c), (2)(d), (2)(e), and (2)(f) do not apply. Furthermore, numerous classifications are not (as of now) documented and thus are omitted. This is an ongoing conflict and we will include them if the situation on the ground changes. The omitted list is located below.

### Omitted Classifications
The following classifications are not (as of now) documented types of Russian war crimes and thus are omitted from the types of classification. 

* (2)(a)

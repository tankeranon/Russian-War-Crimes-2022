The Russian invasion of Ukraine falls under the definition of an international conflict, so sections of Article 8 (2)(c), (2)(d), (2)(e), and (2)(f) do not apply. Furthermore, numerous classifications are not (as of now) documented and thus are omitted. This is an ongoing conflict and we will include them if the situation on the ground changes. Omitted classifications from Article 8 (2)(a) include (vi) Denying a Fair Trial, (v) Compelling Service in Hostile Forces
